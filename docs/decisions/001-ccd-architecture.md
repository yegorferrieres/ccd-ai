# ADR-001: CCD for AI Three-Tier Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The CCD methodology needs a scalable and maintainable architecture for organizing context documentation. Traditional single-level documentation approaches become unwieldy as projects grow, making it difficult to maintain context quality and ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Decision
Implement a three-tier architecture for context documentation:
1. **Repository Level (CODEMAP.yaml)**: High-level project overview and module mapping
2. **Module Level (INDEX.yaml)**: Module-specific purpose, I/O contracts, and file relationships
3. **File Level (.ctx.md)**: Detailed file documentation with structured metadata

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Architecture scales from small to enterprise projects
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes maintenance easier
- **AI Optimization**: Structured format optimized for RAG system consumption
- **Developer Experience**: Clear navigation path from overview to details
- **Quality Assurance**: Each tier can be validated independently

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More complex than single-level approaches
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand three-tier structure
- **Tooling Requirements**: Requires tools to manage all three tiers
- **Coordination**: Updates across tiers need coordination

### Neutral
- **Initial Setup**: More setup time required initially
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Structured approach may require more discipline

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single-Level Architecture
- **Description**: All context in single directory with flat structure
- **Rejection Reason**: Becomes unwieldy as project grows, difficult to maintain quality

### 2. Two-Tier Architecture
- **Description**: Repository level + file level only
- **Rejection Reason**: Missing module-level abstraction, harder to manage dependencies

### 3. Hierarchical File System
- **Description**: Use directory structure to organize context
- **Rejection Reason**: Less flexible, harder to maintain cross-references

### 4. Database-Driven Approach
- **Description**: Store context in database with complex relationships
- **Rejection Reason**: Overkill for most projects, harder to version control

## Implementation Notes

### File Structure
```
docs/
├── codemap.yaml                    # Repository level
├── index/
│   ├── module1.yaml               # Module level
│   └── module2.yaml
└── examples/
    └── module1/
        ├── file1.py.ctx.md        # File level
        └── file2.py.ctx.md
```

### Data Flow
1. **Context Generation**: File → Module → Repository
2. **Context Consumption**: Repository → Module → File
3. **Validation**: All tiers validated independently and together

### Tooling Requirements
- CLI tool to manage all three tiers
- Validation tools for each tier
- Generation tools for automated updates
- Search and navigation tools
