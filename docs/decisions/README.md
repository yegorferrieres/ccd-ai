# CCD for AI Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant technical decisions made during the development of the CCD for AI methodology and its implementation.

## Overview

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during a project's lifecycle. They provide:

- **Historical Context**: Why decisions were made at specific points in time
- **Decision Rationale**: The reasoning behind technical choices
- **Consequences**: Both positive and negative impacts of decisions
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
- **Implementation Guidance**: Technical details for implementing decisions

ADRs serve as a knowledge base for current and future team members, helping them understand the evolution of the system architecture and the reasoning behind design choices.

## What Are ADRs?

### Definition

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a short text file that captures a single architecture decision. It documents:

- **What was decided**: The specific architectural decision
- **When it was decided**: The date and context of the decision
- **Why it was decided**: The reasoning and constraints that led to the decision
- **What the consequences are**: Both positive and negative impacts
- **What alternatives were considered**: Other options that were evaluated

### Benefits

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures institutional knowledge and decision rationale
- **Team Onboarding**: Helps new team members understand system evolution
- **Decision Review**: Enables teams to review and potentially revise past decisions
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Provides clear documentation for stakeholders
- **Risk Mitigation**: Documents decisions that may have long-term consequences

## ADR Format

### Standard Structure

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

```markdown
# [ADR-001] [Brief Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local.

## Decision
State the architecture decision clearly and concisely.

## Consequences

### Positive
- List positive consequences and benefits

### Negative
- List negative consequences and trade-offs

### Neutral
- List neutral consequences and observations

## Alternatives Considered
- **Alternative 1**: Description and rationale for rejection
- **Alternative 2**: Description and rationale for rejection

## Implementation Notes
- **Timeline**: Implementation timeline and milestones
- **Resources**: Required resources and team members
- **Dependencies**: Dependencies and prerequisites
- **Risks**: Implementation risks and mitigation strategies

## Related Decisions
- **Previous ADRs**: Related or superseded ADRs
- **Future ADRs**: ADRs that may be needed in the future

## References
- **Technical Documentation**: Relevant technical documentation
- **Research Papers**: Research papers and academic sources
- **Industry Standards**: Industry standards and best practices
```

### Status Values

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer relevant or has been replaced
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

- **Draft ADR**: Create initial ADR with proposed decision
- **Team Review**: Get feedback from team members and stakeholders
- **Iteration**: Refine ADR based on feedback

### 2. **Decision Phase**

- **Decision Recording**: Record the final decision and rationale
- **Status Update**: Change status to "Accepted"
- **Implementation Planning**: Plan implementation details

### 3. **Implementation Phase**

- **Execute Decision**: Implement the architectural decision
- **Monitor Impact**: Track consequences and outcomes

## Creating New ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when you need to document:

- **Technology Choices**: Selection of frameworks, libraries, or tools
- **Architectural Patterns**: Design patterns and architectural approaches
- **Integration Decisions**: How systems connect and communicate

### ADR Creation Process

#### 1. **Template Usage**

Start with the ADR template:

```bash
cp docs/templates/adr-template.md docs/decisions/adr-001-decision-title.md
```

#### 2. **Content Development**

Fill in the template with:

- **Clear Title**: Descriptive title that captures the decision
- **Comprehensive Context**: All relevant factors and constraints
- **Specific Decision**: Clear statement of what was decided
- **Thorough Analysis**: Complete consequences and alternatives
- **Implementation Details**: Practical guidance for implementation

#### 3. **Review and Approval**

- **Technical Review**: Get technical feedback from team
- **Stakeholder Review**: Ensure stakeholder alignment
- **Final Approval**: Get final approval from decision makers
- **Status Update**: Change status to "Accepted"

### ADR Quality Standards

- **Clarity**: Decision and rationale must be clear and unambiguous
- **Completeness**: All relevant aspects must be covered
- **Objectivity**: Present balanced view of consequences
- **Actionability**: Provide clear implementation guidance
- **Maintainability**: Design for easy updates and maintenance

## ADR Review Process

### Regular Review Schedule

- **Monthly Review**: Review recent ADRs for accuracy
- **Quarterly Review**: Comprehensive review of all ADRs
- **Annual Review**: Major review and cleanup of ADR collection

### Review Criteria

- **Relevance**: Is the ADR still relevant to current architecture?
- **Accuracy**: Is the information accurate and up-to-date?
- **Completeness**: Are all aspects adequately covered?
- **Clarity**: Is the decision and rationale clear?
- **Actionability**: Does it provide useful implementation guidance?

### Review Outcomes

- **Keep**: ADR remains relevant and accurate
- **Update**: ADR needs minor updates or clarifications
- **Supersede**: ADR is replaced by newer decision
- **Archive**: ADR is no longer relevant

## ADR Integration

### Tool Integration

ADRs integrate with CCD tools:

```bash
