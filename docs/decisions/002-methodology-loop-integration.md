# [ADR-002] CCD for AI Methodology Loop Integration

## Status
**Accepted** - Core methodological files integrated into CCD workflow

## Context

The CCD for AI methodology was missing a critical component: integration of project planning, decision tracking, and development history into the main development loop. AI tools and developers needed access to current project state, progress, and architectural decisions to provide accurate assistance and maintain consistency.

**Forces at play**:
- AI tools lacked access to current project planning and progress
- Development decisions were not systematically tracked and accessible
- Project roadmap and engineering log were not part of the continuous context update loop
- No systematic way to keep AI tools synchronized with project methodology state

## Decision

Integrate the core methodological files (roadmap.md, ENGINEERING_LOG.md, decisions/, DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md) into the CCD for AI methodology loop as mandatory components that must be updated after each development iteration.

### Integration Points

1. **roadmap.md** - Project Planning and Progress
   - Must be updated after each development iteration
   - AI tools read this for current project state and next steps
   - Contains milestones, progress indicators, and timeline adjustments

2. **ENGINEERING_LOG.md** - Development History and Patterns
   - Must be updated within 2h of completing any development task
   - AI tools use this for recent patterns and technical context
   - Contains timestamped entries with description, impact, and resolution

3. **decisions/** - Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
   - Must be updated within 24h of making architectural decisions
   - AI tools reference these for architectural context and consistency
   - Contains decision rationale, alternatives, and consequences

4. **DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md** - Workflow and Process Rules
   - Must be updated when workflow improvements are identified
   - AI tools follow these for consistent development practices
   - Contains development workflow, context update rules, and quality gates

### Workflow Integration

```
Start Development → Read Methodological Context → Execute Task → Update Methodological Files → AI Context Update
       ↓                      ↓                      ↓              ↓                        ↓

                                                                                       Methodology State
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Complete Context**: AI tools now have access to full project context including planning and decisions
- **Continuous Synchronization**: Project state is always current and synchronized
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI tools can learn from recent development patterns and decisions
- **Consistency**: Development follows established architectural patterns and workflow rules
- **Knowledge Preservation**: All decisions and patterns are systematically documented

### Negative
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Developers must update methodological files after each iteration
- **Training Requirements**: Team must learn and follow the methodology loop workflow
- **Quality Gates**: Additional validation requirements for methodological file updates
- **Timing Constraints**: Strict SLAs for updates (2h for development tasks, 24h for decisions)

### Neutral
- **Process Standardization**: Establishes consistent methodology across all projects
- **AI Dependency**: AI tools become dependent on methodological file currency
- **Documentation Burden**: Increased documentation requirements for development tasks

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Optional Integration
- **Description**: Make methodological file updates optional
- **Rejection**: Would not ensure AI tools have current context, defeating the purpose

### Alternative 2: Automated Updates
- **Description**: Automatically generate methodological file updates
- **Rejection**: Would lack human insight and decision rationale, reducing quality

### Alternative 3: Separate Workflow
- **Description**: Keep methodological updates separate from main development loop
- **Rejection**: Would create synchronization issues and context drift

### Alternative 4: Minimal Integration
- **Description**: Only integrate essential files (roadmap.md and ENGINEERING_LOG.md)
- **Rejection**: Would miss architectural decision context and workflow rules

## Implementation Notes

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Core integration complete (2025-08-28)
- **Phase 2**: Real project validation (2025-02-15)
- **Phase 3**: AI integration testing (2025-03-01)

### Resources
- **Development Team**: Must follow methodology loop workflow
- **AI Tools**: Must be configured to read methodological files
- **Quality Assurance**: Must validate methodological file compliance

### Dependencies
- **CCD Protocol**: Steps 5-6 for methodological file updates
- **Development Rules**: Updated workflow requirements
- **Quality Gates**: Validation for methodological file updates

### Risks
- **Adoption Resistance**: Team may resist additional documentation requirements
- **Quality Degradation**: Rushed updates may reduce documentation quality
- **AI Context Drift**: Outdated methodological files could mislead AI tools

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Training**: Comprehensive team training on methodology loop workflow
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation of methodological file updates
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of methodological file currency
- **Incentives**: Recognition for maintaining high-quality methodological documentation
