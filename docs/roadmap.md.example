# CCD (Continuous Context Documentation) Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the strategic development plan for CCD methodology, including phases, milestones, priorities, and success metrics. It provides a clear path from initial implementation to enterprise-scale adoption.

## Strategic Vision

### Mission
Transform software development by making context documentation continuously fresh, AI-consumable, and automatically maintained.

### Vision
CCD becomes the industry standard for AI-native software development, enabling teams to build better software faster with comprehensive, always-current context.

### Goals
1. **Eliminate Documentation Debt**: Make stale documentation a thing of the past
2. **Enable AI-First Development**: Provide AI tools with optimal context
3. **Scale Knowledge Transfer**: Preserve and transfer knowledge across teams
4. **Improve Development Velocity**: Reduce onboarding time and improve efficiency

## CCD Methodology Loop

The CCD methodology includes a continuous loop that keeps project planning, decisions, and progress synchronized with development activities. This loop ensures that AI tools and team members always have access to the current state of the project methodology.

### Methodology Loop Components

#### **roadmap.md** - Project Planning and Progress
- **Purpose**: Track project milestones, progress, and timelines
- **Update Frequency**: After each development iteration
- **AI Integration**: AI tools read this file to understand current project state
- **Content**: Milestones, progress indicators, timeline adjustments, next steps

#### **ENGINEERING_LOG.md** - Development History and Patterns
- **Purpose**: Document technical decisions, incidents, and lessons learned
- **Update Frequency**: Within 2h of completing any development task
- **AI Integration**: AI tools use this for context about recent changes and patterns
- **Content**: Timestamped entries with description, impact, resolution, and follow-up

#### **decisions/** - Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- **Purpose**: Document and track important architectural decisions
- **Update Frequency**: Within 24h of making architectural decisions
- **AI Integration**: AI tools reference these for understanding system evolution
- **Content**: Decision rationale, alternatives considered, consequences, implementation notes

#### **DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md** - Workflow and Process Rules
- **Purpose**: Define development workflow and best practices
- **Update Frequency**: When workflow improvements are identified
- **AI Integration**: AI tools follow these rules for consistent development practices
- **Content**: Development workflow, context update rules, quality gates
