# CCD for AI (Continuous Context Documentation for AI) Glossary

## A

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

The ability of CCD tools and processes to work with older versions of context files and schemas.

### Best Practices
Proven methods and techniques for implementing CCD effectively, based on real-world experience and community feedback.

## C

### CCD (Continuous Context Documentation)
A methodology that operationalizes RAG for software development by maintaining continuously updated, AI-consumable context documentation.

### CCD Loop
The continuous feedback cycle: Code Changes → Update Context → Re-index → AI Usage → Telemetry → Back to Code.

### Chunking
The process of breaking large context documents into smaller, digestible pieces for AI consumption, typically 300-800 tokens per chunk.

### CI/CD Integration
The integration of CCD workflows with continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for automated context management.

### Context Card
A structured markdown file (.ctx.md) containing detailed information about a specific file, including purpose, dependencies, and key components.

### Context Coverage
The percentage of modules and files in a project that have corresponding context documentation.

### Context Drift
The divergence between actual code and context documentation, indicating that context has become outdated or inaccurate.

### Context Freshness
The measure of how current context documentation is, typically measured as the time since last update or the percentage of files updated within SLA.

### Context Health Score
A composite metric (0-100) measuring overall context quality, including schema compliance, content quality, and cross-reference integrity.

### Context Manifest
A configuration file defining CCD project settings, including owners, update cadence, chunking guidance, and quality gates.

### Context Packing
The process of archiving and packaging context documentation for distribution, backup, or migration purposes.

### Context Quality Gates
Automated validation checks that ensure context meets quality standards before being accepted into the system.

### Context Update Workflow
The mandatory process for updating context documentation when code changes, ensuring consistency and quality.

### Context Validation
The process of verifying that context documentation meets quality standards, including schema compliance and content validation.

### Cross-Reference Validation
The process of verifying that all links and references between context files are valid and accurate.

## D

### Delta Report
A report showing what context has changed between two points in time, useful for understanding the scope of updates.

### Development Rules
Core principles and workflows that guide how developers interact with context documentation during development.

### Drift MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)
The average time required to fix context drift issues and restore context accuracy.

## E

### Embeddings
Vector representations of context content that enable semantic search and AI consumption.

### Engineering Log
A chronological record of engineering decisions, changes, and their impact, maintained as part of the CCD methodology.

## F

### File-Level Context
The third tier of CCD architecture, providing detailed information about individual files through context cards.

### Forward Compatibility
The ability of CCD tools and processes to work with newer versions of context files and schemas.

### Four-Tier Architecture
The CCD architecture consisting of repository level (CODEMAP.yaml), module level (INDEX.yaml), file level (context cards), and code level (AI-CONTEXT comments) for comprehensive context coverage.

## G

### Governance
The framework of policies, procedures, and decision-making processes that ensure CCD delivers long-term value.

## H

### Health Check
A comprehensive assessment of context health, including quality metrics, coverage, and performance indicators.

## I

### INDEX.yaml
The second tier of CCD architecture, providing module-level information including purpose, I/O contracts, and file relationships.

### Index Update
The process of regenerating embeddings and updating the search index when context changes.

## K

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Measurable metrics that indicate the success and effectiveness of CCD implementation.

## L

### Language-Specific Extraction
The process of extracting relevant information from source code based on the programming language and file type.

### Living Documentation
Documentation that automatically stays current with code changes, eliminating the need for manual updates.

## M

### Module-Level Context
The second tier of CCD architecture, providing information about specific modules and their relationships.

### MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)
The average time required to resolve issues and restore normal operation.

## O

### Observability
The ability to monitor, measure, and understand the performance and health of CCD systems.

### Onboarding Time
The time required for new team members to become productive with the codebase.

## P

### Performance Metrics
Quantitative measures of CCD system performance, including response times and throughput.

### Playbook
A detailed guide for implementing specific CCD processes or handling particular scenarios.

### Precision@K
A metric measuring the percentage of relevant results in the top K retrieved items from a search.

### Protocol
The detailed specification of the CCD loop, including steps, SLAs, SLOs, and KPIs.

## Q

### Quality Gates
Automated checks that ensure context meets quality standards before being accepted.

### Quality Metrics
Measures of context quality, including schema compliance, content quality, and cross-reference integrity.

## R

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
A technique that enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant context from external knowledge sources.

### Repository-Level Context
The first tier of CCD architecture, providing high-level project overview and module mapping.

### Retrieval Precision
The accuracy of context retrieval, measured as the percentage of relevant results returned.

### Roadmap
A strategic plan outlining the phases, milestones, and priorities for CCD implementation.
