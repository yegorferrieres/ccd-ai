# [ADR-001] Microservices Architecture for MartLive AI Video Assistant

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The MartLive AI Video Assistant project requires a scalable, maintainable architecture that can handle real-time video processing, AI model integration, and multiple concurrent users. The system needs to support:
- Real-time video streaming and processing
- AI model integration (ASR, LLM coaching)
- Web-based user interface
- Scalable deployment and maintenance
- Team development across multiple services

The traditional monolithic approach would create several challenges:
- Tight coupling between video processing and AI components
- Difficulty scaling individual components
- Complex deployment and testing procedures
- Limited technology flexibility for different service types
- Single point of failure for the entire system

## Decision
We will implement a microservices architecture with the following characteristics:

1. **Service Decomposition**: Break the system into focused, single-responsibility services
2. **Technology Diversity**: Allow different services to use appropriate technologies (Go for gateway, Python for AI)
3. **Independent Deployment**: Enable services to be deployed, scaled, and maintained independently
4. **API-First Design**: Define clear contracts between services using REST APIs and WebSockets
5. **Event-Driven Communication**: Use asynchronous communication for non-blocking operations

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology stack
- **Team Independence**: Different teams can work on different services simultaneously
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade to the entire system
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be updated without affecting others
- **Testing**: Services can be tested in isolation with mocked dependencies

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Distributed system complexity increases operational overhead
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication adds latency
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across services is more challenging
- **Debugging**: Distributed debugging requires additional tools and techniques
- **Deployment Complexity**: Multiple services require orchestration and monitoring

### Neutral
- **Development Speed**: Initial development may be slower due to setup complexity
- **Resource Usage**: Individual services may use more resources than a monolith
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to understand distributed systems concepts

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Monolithic Architecture
- **Description**: Single application with all functionality
- **Why Rejected**: Would create tight coupling, scaling challenges, and deployment complexity

### Alternative 2: Event Sourcing Architecture
- **Description**: Event-driven architecture with event store
- **Why Rejected**: Adds complexity without clear benefits for our use case

### Alternative 3: Serverless Functions
- **Description**: Function-as-a-Service for individual components
- **Why Rejected**: Limited control over runtime environment and cold start issues

### Alternative 4: Layered Monolith
- **Description**: Monolithic application with clear internal layers
- **Why Rejected**: Still creates coupling and scaling challenges

## Implementation Notes

### Service Boundaries
- **Edge Gateway**: API routing, authentication, rate limiting
- **ASR Service**: Speech recognition and audio processing
- **Coach LLM Service**: AI coaching and response generation
- **Web Demo**: User interface and real-time communication

### Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for request-response operations
- **Asynchronous**: WebSockets for real-time video streaming
- **Event-Driven**: Message queues for background processing

### Technology Stack
- **Edge Gateway**: Go (performance, concurrency)
- **AI Services**: Python (AI/ML ecosystem)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript/HTML5 (real-time capabilities)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes (orchestration, scaling)

### Data Management
- **Service Data**: Each service manages its own data
- **Shared Data**: API contracts define data exchange formats
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency with clear error handling
