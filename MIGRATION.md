# Migration to CCD for AI

## Overview

This document describes the migration process from the original CCD project to the new **CCD for AI** repository at `https://github.com/yegorferrieres/ccd-ai`.

## Why the Migration?

### New Focus on AI

The original CCD (Continuous Context Documentation) project has evolved to specifically focus on AI-native development workflows. The new name **"CCD for AI"** better reflects this focus:

- **AI-First Design**: All documentation is optimized for AI tool consumption
- **RAG Integration**: Native support for Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems
- **AI Tool Enhancement**: Designed to improve AI assistant effectiveness
- **Context Preparation**: Dedicated tools for preparing complete project context for AI developers

### Key Changes

1. **Repository Name**: `ccd` → `ccd-ai`
2. **Project Name**: "CCD (Continuous Context Documentation)" → "CCD for AI (Continuous Context Documentation for AI)"
3. **Enhanced CLI**: New `prepare-context` command for AI developers
4. **Updated Documentation**: All documentation updated with AI-focused terminology
5. **New Examples**: AI-native implementation examples

## Migration Methods

### Method 1: Automated Migration (Recommended)

Use the provided migration script:

```bash
# From the root of your current CCD project
./migrate-to-ccd-ai.sh
```

The script will:
- Create a backup of your current project
- Clone the new ccd-ai repository
- Copy all files with updated branding
- Commit and push changes to the new repository

### Method 2: Manual Migration

If you prefer manual migration:

1. **Create backup**:
   ```bash
   cp -r . ../ccd-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

2. **Clone new repository**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   git clone https://github.com/yegorferrieres/ccd-ai.git
   cd ccd-ai
   ```

3. **Copy files**:
   ```bash
   cp -r ../your-old-ccd-project/* .
   ```

4. **Update references**:
   - Update any hardcoded repository URLs
   - Update CI/CD configurations
   - Update documentation links

5. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: migrate to CCD for AI"
   git push origin main
   ```

## What's New in CCD for AI

### Enhanced CLI Tool

New command for AI developers:
```bash
# Prepare complete project context for AI developer
ccd prepare-context --project-dir . --output task-context.txt

# Preview what would be generated
ccd prepare-context --dry-run

# Skip architecture sections for faster generation
ccd prepare-context --no-architecture
```

### AI-Optimized Documentation

All documentation has been updated to:
- Use "CCD for AI" branding consistently
- Emphasize AI tool integration and benefits
- Include specific examples for AI development workflows
- Provide clearer guidance for AI context preparation

### Updated Repository Structure

The repository structure remains the same, but all content has been updated:
- `README.md` - Updated with CCD for AI branding
- `docs/` - All documentation files updated
- `tools/ccd-cli/` - Enhanced CLI with new AI-focused commands
- Examples updated with AI integration patterns

## Testing the Migration

After migration, verify everything works:

1. **Test CLI installation**:
   ```bash
   cd tools/ccd-cli
   pip install -e .
   ccd --help
   ```

2. **Test new prepare-context command**:
   ```bash
   ccd prepare-context --dry-run
   ```

3. **Verify documentation**:
   ```bash
   # Check that all docs reference "CCD for AI"
   grep -r "CCD for AI" docs/
   ```

## Updating External References

After migration, update:

- **CI/CD Configurations**: Update repository URLs in workflow files
- **Documentation Links**: Update any external documentation that references the old repository
- **Issue Templates**: Update issue and PR templates with new repository information
- **Third-party Integrations**: Update any tools or services that integrate with the repository

## Support

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. **Check the backup**: Your original project backup is preserved
2. **Review logs**: The migration script provides detailed output
3. **Manual fix**: You can manually copy missing files if needed
4. **Community support**: Open an issue in the new ccd-ai repository

## Benefits of CCD for AI

- **Better AI Integration**: Native support for AI development workflows
- **Enhanced Tooling**: New commands specifically designed for AI developers
- **Improved Documentation**: Clear focus on AI use cases and benefits
- **Community Growth**: Better positioning for attracting AI-focused developers
- **Future Development**: Foundation for AI-native features and enhancements
